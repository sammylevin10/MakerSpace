# Information for New Hires

## Mission Statement

We work together to create an impactful learning community where students are given the opportunity to engage in new experiences, develop their skills, and ignite ambition. We welcome the diverse community that is NYU. We celebrate all points of view, striving to create a space that is safe and inclusive for all. We create and continue to foster this community through access to peer support, training, diverse programming, networking opportunities, and resources to turn ideas into reality. The NYU Tandon MakerSpace facilitates experimentation and failure, builds career and life skills, and inspires new connections and creative explorations.

    1.  When coverage is found, post "\_**_ will cover my shift at _**[AM/PM] on [month]/[day]"
    2.  If no coverage has been found 24hrs before the shift, alert MakerSpace Managers via Slack.
    3.  If a shift is missed or managers find coverage for you (see above), this counts as a failure to report (FTR). TAs with 3 FTRs in a semester will be subject to discipline, up to termination.
